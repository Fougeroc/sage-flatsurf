sage-flatsurf
=============

This is a github repository that was started during a thematic semester
at [ICERM](https://icerm.brown.edu/home/index.php) by Vincent Delecroix
and Pat Hooper. It contains some code to interactively draw translation
surfaces from [Sage](http://sagemath.org).

It currently contains a lot of bugs... if you intend to use it, please
contact the authors.

There is also a related [flatsurf package](http://www.labri.fr/perso/vdelecro/programming.html).
The code in this repository is currently independent of the package but
the aim is to get them merged.
